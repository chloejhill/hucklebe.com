**As a sustainability change-agent** - from technical specialists in climate and biodiversity, development agency analysts, NGO workers and tech-smart developers to impact-driven business leaders, philanthropists and grassroots activists  — **one of your principle aims is to convince key decision-makers**, whether that’s national policymakers, business shareholders or indeed individual consumers, to make more informed sustainably-smart choices and decisions that scale up positive impact.

This means that the **more effective and strategic your communications are, the more impact your organisation will have and the more behaviours you will change**. Slowly but surely, one changed mind at a time. 
 
**The cost of ineffective vs effective communications**

**The true value and transformative power that communications - both internal and external - can have, is not fully appreciated nor understood across many organisations**. This means that communication teams and departments are often underfunded, leaving them little space to unleash their full potential to further elevate both business and organisational impact. Whilst the digital revolution  - including the boom in social media - has definitely put communications under the spotlight, more can be done, especially when it comes to strategically effective communications. But is it worth the investment?

Let’s look at the numbers: 

**1.Miscommunication loses money; effective communication earns it**

Research on the financial impact of inadequate internal communication has shown it costs companies with 100 employees a staggering US$402,000 over an average year. For organisations with 100,000 employees, this annual loss soars to US$62.4 million. Consider the relative cost-per-employee for your own organisation: how much value could you save — and add — by investing in training to improve your internal communication capability and as a result, also your external delivery? 

Given that solid internal communication capability is key to creating effective external communications - it’s not surprising that 46% of businesses have lost their audience because of a lack of focus in this area. When it comes to sustainability, we might think of this as lost collaborator, sponsor or consumer interest; missed opportunities to communicate the ways your organisation is striving to change the world for the better; or missed chances to change decision-makers’ mindsets once and for all. 




**An audience that’s overwhelmed with complex information and decisions won’t act. Choose one clear, accessible and achievable action to ask your audience to take.** Show people practical, simple daily actions they can take to make climate-conscious changes. Like buying organic. Travelling by train instead of plane. Making your pointers relatable and easy to action connects people emotionally and practically to sustainability challenges, inspiring real action.
