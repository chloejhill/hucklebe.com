> Setting the World Bank up for communications success in Cambodia - Enhancing their in-country environmental impact

### The Challenge: Ensuring that Cambodia’s long-term sustainability is placed at the heart of the country’s agenda

HuckleBe provided strategic communications advice to the World Bank’s Environment, Natural Resources and Blue Economy Global Practice Hub (ENB) in Cambodia to help enhance their engagement with the Cambodian government and other influential regional as well as global actors around improved decision-making on natural resources management and local livelihoods.

### Our Process: Unpacking target audiences and crafting a tailored communications strategy

By immersing ourselves in ENB’s vision and getting under the skin of both their internal and external audience characteristics, the HuckleBe team carefully articulated a full communications strategy along with a provisional content calendar for the ENB unit for the next 18 months.

### The Solution: Being equipped to have maximum strategic impact

Through the provision of strategic direction and accompanying communications collateral such as carefully crafted key messages, HuckleBe was able to equip the ENB team with the necessary guidance to help set them up for communications success and elevate the impact of their important in-country work.
