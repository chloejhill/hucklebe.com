### An all women-led organisation committed to positive disruption - Co-creating strategic content for a just and resilient world where no one is left behind

#### The Challenge: Getting to the heart of UNA Collective and understanding what's needed to make a societal shift



#### Our Process: Designing and facilitating insight gathering sessions

To help Changeist in their future trend advisory role, HuckleBe set to work by firstly, mapping out potential future trends through a horizon scanning process and then secondly grouping trends under specific categories by applying relevant taxonomies. Casting the net wide and leaving no stone unturned was key to the work.

#### The Solution: Delivering bold impact branding pieces aimed at behaviour change

By uncovering future trends and applying a critical thinking process along with strategic foresight, HuckleBe were able to arm Changeist and the Innovation charity with essential early intelligence on a number of key topics connected with food systems and energy. This intel will be used to shape organizational strategy now and for the future and how they ca best respond to whatâ€™s likely about to happen.
