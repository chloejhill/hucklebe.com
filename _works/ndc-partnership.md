### Putting NDC's work in the spotlight - Helping to combat climate change and build a better future

#### The Challenge: Inspiring the application of climate change solutions

HukcleBe were invited to support the NDC Partnership office in Washington DC as their writing and storytelling team. The purpose of our engagement was to lead on strategic messaging and creative content for several of NDCâ€™s flagship publications which are widely shared with national governments, international institutions, civil society, researchers and the private sector to help fast-track climate and development action.

#### Our Process: Bringing words to life & finding the right story angle

To ensure maximum end user engagement and shareability, our team conducted deep dive research, applied appropriate content framing and humanised data to help bring to life all NDC flagship publications and online material that we were engaged on. By immersing ourselves in NDCs target audiences, we were able to find the right story angle that enabled each carefully crafted message to land.

#### The Solution: Spreading the word and demonstrating possibility

By immersing ourselves in NDCs target audiences as well as the global and urgent climate context, we were able to find the right story angle and craft messages that not only resonate but also help to spread the word on the challenge ahead and what can be done.
