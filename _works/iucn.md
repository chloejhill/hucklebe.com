> Putting nature at the heart of business - Strengthening the business engagement capacities of local conservation organisations

### The Challenge: Inspiring increased engagement between local NGOs and businesses

Global conservation organisation, IUCN in Switzerland, approached HuckleBe to advise on the creative dissemination of the final project outcomes of one of their flagship partnership programmes which focused on strengthening the capacity of local NGOs across Latin America, Asia and Africa to enhance climate resilience, water supply and food security. The purpose of the engagement was to boost engagement between local NGOs and businesses globally.

### Our Process: Getting creative with content and video

Working co-creatively with IUCN, HuckleBe distilled key lessons learnt and experiences from all SRJS 16 case studies into 1) a final project brochure, “Top business engagement tips for conservation organisations” and 2) a short engaging video with music and text overlay.

### The Solution: Crisp messaging with top business engagement tips in an easy-to-share format

By summarizing these lessons and experiences from SRJS local partners into a top tip guide and short video, IUCN were able to provide a roadmap for other conservation organisations who are interested in enhancing their opportunities to engage business in nature.
